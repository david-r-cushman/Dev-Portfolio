# 📝 Sample.ps1

## 💼 Purpose
This script is a **placeholder artifact** created to validate portfolio navigation and README structure. It does not perform any technical automation — its role is to ensure that links, folder organization, and documentation flow are intuitive and recruiter‑friendly.

---

## 📘 Context
- Used during portfolio setup to test navigation between root README, category README, and script‑level README files.  
- Demonstrates how each script in the portfolio will be accompanied by its own documentation.  
- Serves as a template for future script READMEs.

---

## 🚀 How to Explore
- Navigate back to the [PowerShell Scripting](../) folder to see featured categories.  
- Open other script folders (e.g., [Driver-Management](../Driver-Management/)) to view real automation examples with recruiter‑friendly documentation.

## 👔 Value to Employers
While `Sample.ps1` itself is not a technical artifact, its README demonstrates:
- **Consistency**: Every script and module in the portfolio is documented.  
- **Navigation clarity**: Reviewers can easily move between portfolio layers.  
- **Professional polish**: Even placeholders are explained, reinforcing attention to detail.
